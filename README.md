# Example of Form Login and Register Users Creation with Bootstrap 5 Using Jakarta EE and Wildfly

This is a sample project designed to help beginner developers understand the parts and technologies used in creating web applications with Bootstrap 5, Jakarta EE, and Wildfly. The sample application is a simple form application that uses Bootstrap 5 for the user interface.

## Technologies Used

The sample application uses several technologies, including:

- Bootstrap 5: For UI design and styling.
- Jakarta EE: To provide the application framework.
- Wildfly: As a Java application server.

The technical implementation of the application uses several Jakarta EE technologies, including:

- Servlets: To handle client requests.
- JSP: To generate dynamic web pages.
- JPA: To access and manipulate application data in the database.

Additionally, we added the following features:

- MySQL Database: A MySQL database was created to store user data for registration and login.
- User Registration and Login: Registration and login forms were created to allow users to register and access the application.

## Different Ways To Connect To a Database
